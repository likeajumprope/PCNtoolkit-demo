# Longitudinal Normative Modelling protocol for the BLR model
In this tutorial, we showcase the code for the analysis of longitudinal data using the BLR method descirbed elsewhere (see [BLR_protocol](https://github.com/bbuckova/PCNtoolkit-demo/tree/main/tutorials/BLR_protocol)).

The approach is accompanied by a [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.09.544217v1) that describes the mathematics of the method in depth.  

You can run the  notebook in [Google Colab](https://github.com/predictive-clinical-neuroscience/PCNtoolkit-demo/blob/main/tutorials/Long_NM/Long_NM_protocol.ipynb) and follow the instructions.
